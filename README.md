# Building a Pickleball Game with Amazon Q CLI using Vibe Coding Approach
[Amazon Q CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/devops/introducing-the-enhanced-command-line-interface-in-amazon-q-developer/) is a tool you use in the terminal that lets you build things by simply describing what you want to do in plain English. It’s designed for a more relaxed, creative way of coding—sometimes called “vibe coding.”
